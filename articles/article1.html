                Money has been instrumental in how society and commerce have evolved over the centuries. Barter was found to be inefficient, and so humans had to develop another tool that would facilitate trade between people.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1200 B.C., cowrie shells were used as money in the Pacific, in China and some parts of Africa while in other countries animal skins were the valuable things.
                </li>
                <li>In 1000 B.C., China started to use metal in their money. They made metallic cowries using bronze and copper.</li>
                <li>Coins began to catch on and in 500 B.C. in Lydia (in Turkey), coins were made using a mixture of gold and silver. The back portion was stamped, and with precious metals being its core material, the coin had significant value.</li>
                <li>In 806 A.D., paper money started to appear in China because of shortages in copper.</li>
                <li>During the 1600s, banknotes started in England. The ability to pay was backed up with having gold. In 1816, gold became the standard of value in England. The first bank in Europe to issue printed money was Swedish Stockholm Bank in 1661.</li>
                <li>In 1900, the Gold Standard Act was enacted in America which led to the creation of a Central Bank. However, by the end of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the gold standard was dropped.
                </li>
                <li>In 1933 U.S. abandoned the gold standard, and completely removed the link between the dollar and gold in 1971, now USD value is not linked to any specific asset. In other words, the U.S. dollar can’t be considered real money.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From then on, paper money continued to be the standard form of money, and in the 1960s, the first version of credit cards began to emerge. Credit cards remain prevalent today and many countries especially developing nations are still growing in credit card usage. Developed nations, on the other hand, are moving towards digital wallets and other digital payment platforms in their quest for a cashless society.</p>
