                Now money can be stored on digital wallets like Google Pay and Apple Pay. You can also pay online through bank or credit card linked accounts like a PayPal account (or using Venmo). Many countries are pushing towards a cashless society like Japan and Singapore.

            Then came Bitcoin, the first serious virtual currency and is slowly gaining more acceptance globally. A person under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto created the bitcoin currency in 2009 as an answer to the subprime crisis that hit America which ultimately led to a global recession.
            <br><br>
            There are no transaction fees involved when using Bitcoin and there is a growing number of merchants that accept Bitcoin!
            <br><br>
            Also, Bitcoin is not tied to any regulation which allows international transactions to be cheap and easy. Many businesses accept bitcoin because there are no transaction fees unlike when customers use credit cards to pay.
            However, there’s still a big problem in the Bitcoin world — scalability. A report from Juniper Research predicts that the number of active Bitcoin users worldwide will reach 4.7 mln by the end of 2019. That’s very slow… And any other cryptocurrency has the same issue due to problematic scaling future, e.g. “mathematical proof that it is impossible to determine the ‘true’ transaction history in a proof-of-stake blockchain without an additional source of trust”, sharding… Hence, we can look at Bitcoin as an asset rather than a currency.
